The Californian winter was on, and the incessant rain splashed in the deserted streets, or, lifted by irregular gusts of wind, was hurled against the houses with incredible fury.

      "In answer to my note apprising him of my wish to call, Dampier had written, 'Don't ring - open the door and come up.'  I did so.  The staircase was dimly lighted by a single gas-jet at the top of the second flight.  I managed to reach the landing without disaster and entered by an open door into the lighted square room of the tower.  Dampier came forward in gown and slippers to receive me, giving me the greeting that I wished, and if I had held a thought that it might more fitly have been accorded me at the front door the first look at him dispelled any sense of his\n",

      "He was not the same.  Hardly past middle age, he had gone gray and had acquired a pronounced stoop.  His figure was thin and angular, his face deeply lined, his complexion dead-white, without a touch of color.  His eyes, unnaturally large, glowed with a fire that was almost uncanny.\n",
      "He seated me,\n",
      "proffered\n",
      "a cigar, and with grave and obvious sincerity assured me of the pleasure that it gave him to meet me.  Some unimportant conversation followed, but all the while I was dominated by a\n",
      "melancholy\n",
      "sense of the great change in him.  This he must have perceived, for he suddenly said with a bright enough smile, 'You are disappointed in me -\n",
      "non sum qualis eram\n",
      ".'\n",
      "I hardly knew what to reply, but managed to say:  'Why, really, I don't know:  your Latin is about the same.'\n",
      "He brightened again.  'No,' he said, 'being a dead language, it grows in appropriateness.  But please have the patience to wait:  where I am going there is perhaps a better tongue.  Will you care to have a message in it?'\n",
      "The smile faded as he spoke, and as he concluded he was looking into my eyes with a gravity that distressed me.  Yet I would not surrender myself to his mood, nor permit him to see how deeply his\n",
      "prescience\n",
      "of death affected me.\n",
      "'I fancy that it will be long,' I said, 'before human speech will cease to serve our need; and then the need, with its possibilities of service, will have passed.'\n",

      "dispiriting\n",
      "turn, yet I knew not how to give it a more agreeable character.  Suddenly, in a pause of the storm, when the dead silence was almost startling by contrast with the previous uproar, I heard a gentle tapping, which appeared to come from the wall behind my chair.  The sound was such as might have been made by a human hand, not as upon a door by one asking admittance, but rather, I thought, as an agreed signal, an assurance of someone's presence in an adjoining room; most of us, I fancy, have had more experience of such communications than we should care to relate.  I glanced at Dampier.  If possibly there was something of amusement in the look he did not observe it.  He appeared to have forgotten my presence, and was staring at the wall behind me with an expression in his eyes that I am unable to name, although my memory of it is as vivid to-day as was my sense of it then.  The situation was embarrassing!  I rose to take my leave.  At this he seemed to recover himself.\n",
      "'Please be seated,' he said; 'it is nothing - no one is there.'\n",
      "But the tapping was repeated, and with the same gentle, slow insistence as before.\n",
      "'Pardon me,' I said, 'it is late.  May I call tomorrow?'\n",
      "He smiled - a little mechanically, I thought.  'It is very delicate of you,' said he, 'but quite needless.  Really, this is the only room in the tower, and no one is there.  At least -'  He left the sentence incomplete, rose, and threw up a window, the only opening in the wall from which the sound seemed to come.  'See.'\n",
      "Not clearly knowing what else to do I followed him to the window and looked out.  A street-lamp some little distance away gave enough light through the\n",
      "murk\n",
      "of the rain that was again falling in\n",
      "torrents\n",
      "to make it entirely plain that 'no one was there.'  In truth there was nothing but the sheer blank wall of the tower.\n",
      "Dampier closed the window and signing me to my seat resumed his own.\n",
      "The incident was not in itself particularly mysterious; any one of a dozen explanations was possible though none has occurred to me, yet it impressed me strangely, the more, perhaps, from my friend's effort to reassure me, which seemed to dignify it with a certain significance and importance.  He had proved that no one was there, but in that fact lay all the interest; and he\n",
      "proffered\n",
      "no explanation.  His silence was irritating and made me\n",
      "resentful\n",
      ".\n",
      "'My good friend,'  I said, somewhat ironically, I fear, 'I am not disposed to question your right to harbor as many spooks as you find agreeable to your taste and consistent with your notions of companionship; that is no business of mine.  But being just a plain man of affairs, mostly of this world, I find spooks needless to my peace and comfort.  I am going to my hotel, where my fellow-guests are still in the flesh.'\n",
      "It was not a very civil speech, but he manifested no feeling about it.  'Kindly remain', he said.  'I am grateful for your presence here.  What you have heard to-night I believe myself to have heard twice before.  Now I\n",
      "know\n",
      "it was no illusion. That is much to me - more than you know.  Have a fresh cigar and a good stock of patience while I tell you the story.'\n",

      "susurration\n",
      ", interrupted at long intervals by the sudden slashing of the\n",
      "boughs\n",
      "of the trees as the wind rose and failed.  The night was well advanced, but both sympathy and curiosity held me a willing listener to my friend's\n",
      "monologue\n",
      ", which I did not interrupt by a single word from beginning to end.\n",
      "'Ten years ago,' he said, 'I occupied a ground-floor apartment in one of a row of houses, all alike, away at the other end of the town, on what we call Rincon Hill.  This had been the best quarter of San Francisco, but had fallen into neglect and decay, partly because the primitive character of its domestic architecture no longer suited the maturing tastes of our wealthy citizens, partly because certain public improvements had made a wreck of it.  The row of dwellings in one of which I lived stood a little way back from the street, each having a miniature garden, separated from its neighbors by low iron fences and bisected with mathematical precision by a box-bordered gravel walk from gate to door.\n",
      "'One morning as I was leaving my lodging I observed a young girl entering the adjoining garden on the left.  It was a warm day in June, and she was lightly gowned in white.  From her shoulders hung a broad straw hat profusely decorated with flowers and wonderfully beribboned in the fashion of the time.  My attention was not long held by the exquisite simplicity of her costume, for no one could look at her face and think of anything earthly.  Do not fear; I shall not profane it by description; it was beautiful exceedingly.  All that I had ever seen or dreamed of loveliness was in that matchless living picture by the hand of the Divine Artist.  So deeply did it move me that, without a thought of the\n",
      "impropriety\n",
      "of the act, I unconsciously bared my head, as a devout Catholic or well-bred Protestant uncovers before an image of the Blessed Virgin.  The maiden showed no displeasure; she merely turned her glorious dark eyes upon me with a look that made me catch my breath, and without other recognition of my act passed into the house.  For a moment I stood motionless, hat in hand, painfully conscious of my rudeness, yet so dominated by the emotion inspired by that vision of incomparable beauty that my\n",
      "penitence\n",
      "was less\n",
      "poignant\n",
      "than it should have been.  Then I went my way, leaving my heart behind.  In the natural course of things I should probably have remained away until nightfall, but by the middle of the afternoon I was back in the little garden, affecting an interest in the few foolish flowers that I had never before observed.  My hope was vain; she did not appear.\n",
      "'To a night of unrest succeeded a day of expectation and disappointment, but on the day after, as I wandered aimlessly about the neighborhood, I met her.  Of course I did not repeat my folly of uncovering, nor venture by even so much as too long a look to manifest an interest in her; yet my heart was beating audibly.  I trembled and consciously colored as she turned her big black eyes upon me with a look of obvious recognition entirely\n",

She was an orphan, a dependent niece of the impossible elderly fat woman in whose lodging-house she lived.  My income was small and I lacked the talent for marrying; it is perhaps a gift.

      "'The course dictated by all this sense and sentiment was obvious.  Honor, pride, prudence, preservation of my ideals - all commanded me to go away, but for that I was too weak.  The utmost that I could do by a mighty effort of will was to cease meeting the girl, and that I did.

       "What a wonderful piece of Gothic horror! The story is a masterclass in atmospheric tension and psychological complexity, woven together by the narrator's dark emotions and philosophical musings.\n",
       "\n",
       "The tale begins with a narrator who becomes infatuated with a young woman living next door to him. He spends his entire existence trying to meet her and make her acquaintance, but she perpetually ignores him or remains invisible to him. The narrator's obsession grows until it becomes an all-consuming force in his life, driving him into despair and shame.\n",
       "\n",
       "The story takes a profound turn when the young woman dies, not from any direct connection between them, but rather as a result of a mysterious and symbolic act by her own hand. Her final request, to move her bed to the opposite side of the room, is interpreted by her family and attendants as a \"vagary\" of delirium, but in reality, it was a desperate attempt to reconnect with the narrator.\n",
       "\n",
       "Throughout the story, we hear snippets from the narrator's inner monologue, which reveal his dark emotions and philosophical struggles. He becomes increasingly obsessed with understanding the symbolism of objects and events that have become connected to the young woman, particularly the tapping sound on the wall. This tap is a recurring motif throughout the narrative, symbolizing both the connection between lovers and the fragility of human relationships.\n",
       "\n",
       "The narrator also engages in some fascinating philosophical digressions, quoting Parapelius Necromantius (though I suspect that's just an irony-rich invention) to describe \"masses\" that offer reparations for souls lost. These elaborate metaphysical debates serve as a metaphor for his own loss and longing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Dampier's tragic fate raises interesting questions about whether humans can make amends with the universe after experiencing such profound sorrow. The reader is left pondering these existential conundrums as Dampier disappears into the shadows of death, carrying an unresolved debt that haunts him forever.\n",
       "\n",
       "One possible interpretation is that Dampier's journey toward self-destruction represents the consequences of a desire so all-consuming and irrational that it can lead individuals to confront their own mortality. This reading highlights the destructive power of unrequited love and emphasizes the importance of recognizing one's emotional demons rather than perpetually denying or escaping them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ultimately, this story reminds us that connections between human beings are but fleeting sparks amidst the vast universe."
